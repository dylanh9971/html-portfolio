<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a very outgoing sociable person with an interest in almost everything but praticularly weight lifting and physical activity. I have always had a strong passion for my physical
  health and wellbeing but I equally share the same level of passion for technology,
  I have been around computers and technology since I was a boy, learning from my older
  siblings and observing them.
</p>

<p>I am originally from Ireland, county down but I am currently living in Belgium with my partner. I aim to travel more of the world 
  as I grow older.
</p>

<p>My mother tounge is English but I can also speak Irish at a higher level. I havent spoken Irish for over 6 years now and the language
  is slowly leaving me; My partner is an Irish teacher and we communicate through Irish when we can. I have
  always loved the Irish culture and its language and regret not keeping it but my partner reminds me its still there it just needs to be brought back to life through
  conversation.
